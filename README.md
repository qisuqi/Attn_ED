# Attn_ED

Using Encoder-Decoder with Attention Mechanism (AttnED) as the prediction model, and have three post-hoc XAI methods to choose from to explain the mode - DiCE, LIME, and SHAP. Using AttnED with SHAP is accepted at the AI4H Workshop at the 16TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SIGNAL IMAGE TECHNOLOGY & INTERNET BASED SYSTEMS. Titled "Predicting and Explaining Hearing Aid Usage Using Encoder-Decoder with Attention Mechanism and SHAP" doi:10.1109/SITIS57111.2022.00053.
