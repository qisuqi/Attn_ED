# AttnED

Using Encoder-Decoder with Attention Mechanism (AttnED) as the prediction model, and have three post-hoc XAI methods to choose from to explain the model - DiCE, LIME, and SHAP. 

Using AttnED with SHAP is accepted at the AI4H Workshop at the 16TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SIGNAL IMAGE TECHNOLOGY & INTERNET BASED SYSTEMS as first author. Titled "Predicting and Explaining Hearing Aid Usage Using Encoder-Decoder with Attention Mechanism and SHAP".

## Demo
